An experimental jumper game which runs inside Godot Engine's editor as a dock.

> Note: This was done on Godot Version 3.3.2 Stable

## Results

SLOW AF. It's **expected**. Godot Engine is simply also an application itself and you can't except a part of it to run a game for you duh!

## How to what?
> Yes this is available in Godot AssetLibs

If you want to check this out yourself but aren't fimilar with Godot Plugins then the official documention is your friend *(Also has info about that 'AssetLibs' thingy if you don't know)*:
